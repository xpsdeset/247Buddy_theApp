# About
247Buddy uses react native(node js) , with a layer of expo. Why expo because I don't own a mac and I hated the long process of android studio development. It uses web sockets for communication. 


# Installation 
Install expo 

    npm install exp --global
    
Install dependencies 

    npm install
    
Start 

    exp start

Notes:

 1. Configure the path to socket.io [here](services/socket.js)
 2. The project is still scrambled, feel free to add your expertise and give it shape.
 3. The websockets are hosted on [247Buddy_theService](https://github.com/xpsdeset/247Buddy_theService)
